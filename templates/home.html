                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>Glen Park Parent Teacher Organization (GPPTO) is a nonprofit parent teacher organization.
                        The PTO's mission is to promote understanding between parents, teachers, students and the
                        greater community, and to work together to make Glen Park Elementary the best it can be.</p>

                <div class="span8">
                    <h2>Get Involved!</h2>
                    <p>When parents get connected to the school, children do better. Thousands of research studies show
                        that children whose parents are involved get better grades, do better on tests, and have fewer
                        discipline problems at school. Just a few hours can make a tremendous difference!</p>

                    <p>Whether you have one day a month or one day a week, volunteering your time at Glen Park
                        Elementary makes a world of difference in our students’ lives. As part of the Glen Park School
                        community, you are automatically a member of the Glen Park Parent Teacher Organization.
                        The PTO is the vehicle that lets parents really get involved at Glen Park School. By necessity,
                        the PTO has begun to raise funds to continue many of our great programs. But we are also about
                        building community and family involvement at the school.</p>

                    <h2>In the Classroom</h2>
                    <p>Ask your teacher about working in the classroom. Parents are needed to help with prep work,
                        read to the class, with art projects and lots more! Being a chaperone on a field trip is also
                        a great help to your teacher and a fun way to get to know your child's classmates.</p>

                    <h2>Around the School</h2>
                    <p>Volunteers are always needed all round the school.  Help on the yard at lunch and recess.
                        We&quotll train you and give you the resources you need to make sure play time is fun and safe
                        for all our students. Volunteering in the library can mean restacking the books, setting up a
                        thematic display or reading to a class.</a></p>

                    <h2>At an Event</h2>
                    <p>Many of Glen Park’s wonderful events simply could not be pulled off without the help of PTO
                        volunteers. People are always needed to help setup and clean-up, sell food, paint faces.
                        There is a job for everyone and the list goes on and on. Volunteering at an event is a great
                        way to meet other Glen Park families and is always a lot of fun.</a></p>
